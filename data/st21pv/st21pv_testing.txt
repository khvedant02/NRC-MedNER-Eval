In O
this O

we O
are O

other O
: O
the O
more O
accepted O
theory O
- O
the O
' O
number O

' O
theory O
- O
suggesting O
that O
a O
sense O

is O
innate O
and O
non-symbolic O

is O
being O

, O

; O
and O
the O
newly O
emerging O
theory O
suggesting O
that O
( O

) O
both O
numerosities O
and O
continuous O
magnitudes O
are O
processed O
holistically O
when O
comparing O
numerosities O
, O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
a O
sense O

might O
not O
be O
innate O
. O

In O
the O
first O
part O
of O
this O
review O
, O
we O
discuss O
the O
' O
number O
sense O
' O
theory O
. O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
we O
demonstrate O
how O
the O
natural O
correlation O
between O
numerosities O
and O
continuous O
magnitudes O
makes O
it O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
study O
non-symbolic O
numerosity O

in O
isolation O
from O
continuous O

, O

can O
be O
explained O
, O
at O
least O
in O
part O
, O
by O
relying O
on O
continuous O
magnitudes O
. O

In O
the O
second O
part O
, O
we O
explain O
the O
' O
sense B-biologic_function
of I-biologic_function
magnitude O
' O
theory O
and O
review O
studies O
that O
directly O
demonstrate O
that O
continuous O
magnitudes O
are O
more O
automatic O
and O
basic O
than O
numerosities O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
present O
outstanding O
questions O
. O

Our O
conclusion O
is O
that O
there O
is O
not O
enough O
convincing O
evidence O
to O
support O
the O
number O
sense O
theory O
anymore O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
encourage O
researchers O
not O
to O
assume O
that O
number O
sense O
is O
simply O
innate O
, O
but O
to O
put O
this O
hypothesis O
to O
the O
test O
, O
and O
to O
consider O
if O
such O
an O
assumption O
is O
even O
testable O

Four-Dimensional B-spatial_concept

Both O
the O
multidimensional B-spatial_concept
phenomenon O
and O
the O
polysemous O
notion O
of O
consciousness B-biologic_function
continue O
to O
prove O
resistant O
to O
consistent O
measurement O
and O
unambiguous B-intellectual_product
definition I-intellectual_product
. O

This O
is O
hardly O
surprising O
, O
given O
that O
there O
is O
no B-finding
agreement I-finding
even O
as O
regards O
the O
most O
fundamental O
issues B-finding
they O
involve O
. O

One O
of O
the O
basic O
disagreements O
present O
in O
the O
continuing O
debate O
about O
consciousness B-biologic_function
pertains O
to O
its O
gradational B-intellectual_product
nature O
. O

The O
general O
aim O
of O
this O
article B-intellectual_product
is O
to O
show O
how O
consciousness B-biologic_function
might O
be O
graded B-intellectual_product
and O
multidimensional B-spatial_concept
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

We O
therefore O
focus O
on O
the O
question B-intellectual_product
of O
what O
it O
is O
, O
exactly O
, O
that O
is O
or O
could O
be O
graded B-intellectual_product
in O
cases O
of O
consciousness B-biologic_function
, O
and O
how O
we O
can O
measure O
it O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
four O
different O
gradable B-intellectual_product
aspects O
of O
consciousness B-biologic_function
will O
be O
described O
: O
quality O
, O
abstractness O
, O
complexity B-biologic_function
and O
usefulness O
, O
which O
belong O
to O
four O
different O
dimensions O
, O
these O
being O
understood O
, O
respectively O
, O
as O
phenomenal O
, O
semantic O
, O
physiological O
, O
and O
functional O
. O

Consequently O
, O
consciousness B-biologic_function
may O
be O
said O
to O
vary O
with O
respect O
to O
phenomenal O
quality O
, O
semantic O
abstraction O
, O
physiological O
complexity B-biologic_function
, O
and O
functional O
usefulness O
. O

It O
is O
hoped O
that O
such O
a O
four-dimensional B-spatial_concept
approach O
will O
help O
to O
clarify O
and O
justify O
claims O
about O
the O
hierarchical O
nature O
of O
consciousness B-biologic_function
. O

The O
approach B-spatial_concept
also O
proves O
explanatorily O
advantageous O
, O
as O
it O
enables O
us O
not O
only O
to O
draw O
attention B-biologic_function

certain O
new O
and O
important O
differences O
in O
respect O
of O
subjective O
measures O

to O
justify O
how O
a O
given O

may O
be O
ranked B-intellectual_product
higher O
in O
one O
dimension O

On O

According O

these O

our O

However O

We O
have O

more O
recent O

Here O

that O
